Welcome to the Famous Base
##Dependencies
It is actually quite simple really

First make sure you have node.js and grunt-cli installed

```
brew install node
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

If you are installing node for the fist time you will most likely need to add npm to your path

```
$ expot PATH="/usr/localshare/npm/bin:$PATH"
```

You will probably want to add that to you .bash_profile.  I'll assume if you are using any other shell that you know what you are doing already :P

##Getting Started

```
npm install && bower install
```

That's it!!!

##Running the Development Server

Simply run ```grunt serve``` and you will start a local development server and open a browser.  Watch tasks will be running, and your browser will be automatically refreshed whenever a file in the repo changes.
